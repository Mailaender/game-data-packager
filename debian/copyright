  License
 .
  THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
  COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
  COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
  AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
  BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
  TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
  BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
  CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
  CONDITIONS.
 .
  1. Definitions
 .
  1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
      anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
      unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
      constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
      assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
      below) for the purposes of this License.
  2.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
      at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
      approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
      License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
      terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
      Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
      relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that
      license under this License or either a Creative Commons unported
      license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
      License Elements as this License.
  3.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
      arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
      version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
      transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
      Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
      purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
      is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
      the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
      considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
  4.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
      as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
      Attribution, ShareAlike.
  5.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
  6.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
      entities who created the Work.
  7.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
      terms of this License.
  8.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
      with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
      from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
      previous violation.
 .
  2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
  limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
  limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
  copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
  Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
  perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
  exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collective Works;
  2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
      Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
      that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
      translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
      English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
      work has been modified.";
  3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
      transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
  4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
      publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
      transmission Derivative Works.
  5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
      1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
          the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
          event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
          (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
          public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
          of the Work.
      2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
          rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
          royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
          version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
          created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
          equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
  6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
      exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
      performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
      public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
      the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
      Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
  known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
  such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
  in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
  are hereby reserved.
 .
  4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
  made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
      You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
      this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
      distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
      that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
      recipient of the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
      Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
      and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
      display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
      You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
      restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
      of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
      Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
      from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
      License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
      requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
      Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
      Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
      requested.
  2.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of
      this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
      License Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons
      (Unported) license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
      (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
      License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
      (Unported)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
      license the Derivative Work under one of the licenses mentioned in
      (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
      the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned
      in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
      with the terms of the Applicable License generally and with the
      following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
      Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with every copy or
      phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
      display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II) You
      may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
      restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
      recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
      keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
      the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute,
      publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
      the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
      Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
      Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section
      4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
      Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
      Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
      Applicable License.
  3.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
      digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
      Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
      (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
      the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
      utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
      applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
      Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
      institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
      Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
      other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
      of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
      Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
      associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
      copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
      consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
      credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
      "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
      based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
      this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
      provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
      Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
      for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
      Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
      as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
      the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
      Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
      and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
      implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
      sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
      Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
      without the separate, express prior written permission of the
      Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
  OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
  LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
  OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
  MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
  THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
  JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
  EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
  LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
  ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
  ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
  BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
  7. Termination
 .
  1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
      Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
      Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
      their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
      remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
      7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
  2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
      is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
      Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
      release the Work under different license terms or to stop
      distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
      election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
      license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
      of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
      effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
  8. Miscellaneous
 .
  1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
      defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
      Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
      You under this License.
  2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
      Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
      Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.
  3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
      applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
      of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
      action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
      reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
      valid and enforceable.
  4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
      breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
      consent.
  5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
      with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
      agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
      here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
      may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
      modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
      You.

    license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
