Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that only one half can be distributed
 in Debian.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building .deb
 files for:
  * Doom games: Doom, Doom II, Final Doom & Doom III
  * LGeneral (Panzer General)
  * Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders
  * Hexen: Beyond Heretic
  * Hexen II
  * Quake and its expansions Scourge of Armagon and Dissolution of Eternity
  * Quake II and its expansions Ground Zero and The Reckoning
  * Quake III Arena
  * Return to Castle Wolfenstein
  * Rise of the Triad
  * Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast
  * Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy
  * Tyrian
  * Wolfenstein 3D
