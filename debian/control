Description: Installer for game data files
 Various games are divided into two logical parts: engine
 and data. Often the engine and data are licensed in
 different ways, such that only one half can be distributed
 in Debian.
 .
 game-data-packager is a tool which builds .deb files for game
 data which cannot be distributed in Debian (such as
 commercial game data).
 .
 At the moment, game-data-packager has support for building .deb
 files for:
 .
  * Chex Quest and Chex Quest 2
  * The Curse of Monkey Island
  * Day of the Tentacle
  * Descent and Descent II
  * Doom, Doom II, Final Doom, Doom III and Doom III BFG Edition
  * Full Throttle
  * Grim Fandango
  * HacX
  * Heretic, Hexen and Hexen II
  * LGeneral (Panzer General)

Description: graphical launcher for DOOM II Master Levels
 This tool provides a graphical interface to
 choose one of DOOM II's Master Levels, read its description
 and start it with the engine of your choice.
 .
 This replicates the functionality of the doomit.exe utility
 that was shipped with the game.
