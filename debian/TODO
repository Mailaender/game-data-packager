TODO:

* do away with ./Makefile and build entirely from debian/rules
  -> unless some other distro finds GDP usefull and start packaging it

* reconsider: why do this?
* provide configurable methods for elevating privs
* provide configurable methods for installing packages
  - dpkg
  - gdebi, this handle Depends: , but doesn't install 'Recommends:' (=game-engine)
  - apt-get, but this needs that #47379 from 1999 to be fixed
  - integrate with graphical package managers ?

	nicer -i behaviour
		support (somehow) installing a generated .deb and throwing
		it away (current behaviour is now, generate and store in	
		$(pwd) if otherwise unspecified; impossible not to preserve
		generated file)
